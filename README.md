# Doctor-Appointment-Project
Project on Patient and Doctor appointment booking system by using core python.

Overview:

The Doctor and Patient Appointment System is a Python-based application designed to manage appointments between doctors and patients in a medical setting. It allows doctors and patients to be registered into the system, appointments to be scheduled, and provides functionality to view booked appointments.

Functionality:

Adding Doctors and Patients:- Users can input details to register new doctors and patients into the system.

Booking Appointments:- Users can schedule appointments by selecting a doctor and a patient, along with the appointment date and time.

Viewing Appointments:- Users can see a list of all scheduled appointments, displaying relevant details such as doctor name, patient name, date, and time.

Error Handling:- The system includes checks to ensure that doctors and patients exist before booking an appointment, and provides feedback if either is not found.

Implementation:

Object Oriented Approach:- The project uses object-oriented programming principles in Python to create classes for doctors, patients, appointments, and the main system.

Command Line Interface (CLI):- The user interacts with the system through a text-based interface where options are presented and input is taken via standard input (keyboard).

Data Storage:- The system manages data in memory using lists (doctors, patients, appointments) which are populated and manipulated based on user input.

Benefits:

Efficiency:- Streamlines the process of managing appointments, reducing manual effort and potential errors.

Organization:- Provides a centralized system for doctors and patients to coordinate and keep track of scheduled appointments.

Accessibility:- Offers a straightforward interface that can be used by medical staff and patients alike.

Conclusion:

The Doctor and Patient Appointment System project in Python demonstrates the application of object-oriented programming principles to create an efficient and organized way to manage medical appointments. It provides essential functionalities for doctors and patients to interact seamlessly, ensuring effective scheduling and coordination within a medical practice or healthcare facility.Project on Patient and Doctor appointment booking system by using core python.Overview
